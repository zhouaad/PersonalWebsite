                        The rise of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> has revolutionized language learning tools, offering opportunities to enhance educational experiences.
                        SentenSnap leverages these technologies to provide a dynamic, <strong>AI-powered platform</strong> that supports English language learners through interactive features like <strong>word snapshots</strong>, <strong>quote generation</strong>, and <strong>image creation</strong>.
                        Using state-of-the-art open-source models like <strong>Qwen 2.5</strong> for text generation and <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> for visual aids, we optimized the system for performance and usability despite local computational limitations.
                        Our evaluation, based on both objective metrics and user feedback, showed promising results, with high accuracy in word snapshots (<strong>~90%</strong>) and quote generation (<strong>~80%</strong>), and an overall user experience rating of <strong>4.5 out of 5</strong>.
                        Future work will focus on enhancing <strong>personalization</strong> and improving <strong>system efficiency</strong>, as well as expanding functionality to further engage users in their language learning journey.
                        Through continued development, SentenSnap aims to become a transformative tool for personalized language acquisition.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Electrocardiography (ECG)</strong> and <strong>Photoplethysmography (PPG)</strong> are two widely used techniques for monitoring <strong>cardiovascular activity</strong>. 
                            ECG is a well-established method for detecting the <strong>electrical activity</strong> of the heart, while PPG utilizes <strong>optical technology</strong> to measure variations in blood volume in peripheral tissues. 
                            This thesis explores two applications of PPG and ECG signals, utilizing a PPG dataset with <strong>Human Activity Recognition</strong> labels and an ECG dataset labeled with various cardiac conditions. 
                            Preprocessing was carried out on the raw <strong>time-series data</strong>, through <strong>detrending</strong>, <strong>bandpass filtering</strong>, and <strong>outlier exclusion</strong>. 
                            Two reduced versions of the data were also considered, one using <strong>Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</strong> summary measures, and the other a <strong>spectral representation</strong> based on the <strong>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong>. 
                            <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> and <strong>predictive data modeling</strong> using <strong>machine learning</strong> techniques were then performed on the preprocessed datasets. 
                            We comment on the predictive performance of the models, try to understand the results from a physiological perspective, and suggest possible directions for future work.
